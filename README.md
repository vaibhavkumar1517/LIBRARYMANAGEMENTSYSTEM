# LIBRARYMANAGEMENTSYSTEM
Hello, in the below main.py file I have written a piece of code using the concept of Object Oriented Programming. The code is a representation of the Library Management System which basically allows us to enter a list of books and perform operations like- viewing a list of books available, borrowing a book and returning a book. I have made use of 2 classes "Library" and "Student". In the "Library" class, there are 3 functions for different operations like displaying the available books and for issuing and returning a particular book. In the "Student" class, the 2 functions are for borrowing and returning a particular book by a student. 
   [ SIDENOTE: ]   Sorry, as of now I have a general idea of the MERN stack and what it is, but I dont know how to implement it together which actually was required in this assignment. I am sure if you give me a chance I will stand out and learn Node.js and MongoDB within 2 weeks and hence I will be able to make a complete project out of it. Well, I learned python within 3 weeks and one may take this as an example that I am a quick learner and dedicated. Thank you for your time.
